# Variations on a Theme: JavaScript

Here you find the source code to the book, the book as [pdf](https://github.com/rplano/book6_JavaScript/raw/main/Variations_on_a_Theme_JavaScript.pdf "pdf") and the book in [HTML](https://rplano.github.io/book6_JavaScript/ "HTML") format.  Note, the HTML version allows you to try all the examples directly in the browser.

## A notice to users of mobile devices 
On mobile devices the browsers behave quite a bit different.  I got almost all examples to work on iPad/Safari and on Android/Firefox.  But for instance, Android/Chrome does not have a keyPress event for whatever reason.  The sound examples most likely will not work on any mobile devices.   In some cases, especially graphics programs, the onScreenKeyboard will not work.  Here a bluetooth keyboard should be the solution.
