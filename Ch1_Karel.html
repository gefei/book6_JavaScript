				<h1>
					Karel</h1>
				<p>
					Karel is a little robot that looks a bit like an old iMac. On the following pages we will learn a
					lot from Karel. Although it seems trivial, in this chapter we probably learn the most important
					lesson of the whole book, namely to break down complex problems into simpler ones with the top-down
					approach.</p>
				<p>
					A little note for people who already know how to program a bit: don&#39;t skip this chapter! In
					principle, this chapter is about learning and practicing the top-down approach with simple examples,
					getting used to a good coding style, and learn how to code without using variables.</p>
				<p>
					.</p>
				<h2>
					Karel&#39;s World</h2>
				<p>
					Karel&#39;s world consists of streets and avenues. Streets run from west to east and avenues from
					south to north. Besides, there are walls Karel can&#39;t go through, and there are beepers. Karel
					always carries a bag with an infinite number of beepers, but beepers can also lie around anywhere in
					his world.</p>
				<p>
					Karel knows only four commands:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>move():</strong>&nbsp; he can move one step forward,
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>turnLeft():</strong>&nbsp; he can turn to the left,
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>pickBeeper():</strong>&nbsp; he can pick up a beeper, and
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>putBeeper():</strong>&nbsp; he can put a beeper down.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Although it doesn&#39;t look like much, it turns out that Karel can calculate anything there is to
					calculate, we say Karel is a &#39;universal computing machine&#39;.</p>
				<p>
					.</p>
				<div style="display:block; float: right; margin: 10px;">
					<a href="./src/Ch1_Karel/tryItKarel.html?name=firstKarel"
						style="display: block; text-align: center;" target="_blank"><img alt=""
							src="img/firstKarel2.png" style="width: 200px; height: 121px; display: block;" />Try it</a>
				</div>
				<h2>
					Karel learns to walk</h2>
				<p>
					If we want Karel to pick up the beeper at location (3,2) and carry it to location (5,2), we would
					tell him:</p>
				<p>
					&quot;Karel, take two steps forward, then pick up the beeper, turn left, move one step forward, turn
					three times to the left, move two more steps forward and put down the beeper.&quot;</p>
				<p>
					Why should Karel turn three times to the left? Because he doesn&#39;t know how to &#39;turn to the
					right&#39;, nobody has ever shown him that.</p>
				<p>
					Since Karel doesn&#39;t understand English, we have to talk to him in his language. which sounds
					like this:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">
move();
move();
pickBeeper();
turnLeft();
move();
turnLeft();
turnLeft();
turnLeft();
move();
move();
putBeeper();</pre>
				<p>
					Like nobody really understands why you need these funny punctuation marks in English (like commas,
					periods etc.), nobody knows why Karel needs these round brackets (called parentheses) and
					semicolons. But we can&#39;t do without them. Karel also pays meticulous attention to upper and
					lower case, if we make a typo he does nothing at all.</p>
				<p>
					.</p>
				<h2>
					Karel Program</h2>
				<p>
					So for Karel to start his chores we need something called a &#39;program&#39;.&nbsp; This is
					actually JavaScript, but we don&#39;t need to know that.&nbsp; A Karel program looks like this:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">
function run() {
<span style="color:#0000ff;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;move();
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;move();
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;pickBeeper();
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;turnLeft();
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;move();
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;turnLeft();
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;turnLeft();
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;turnLeft();
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;move();
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;putBeeper();</span>
}</pre>
				<p>
					The part that is important for us is marked in blue.&nbsp; In all that follows we will simply insert
					our Karel commands (also called code) replacing the blue lines above. We don&#39;t care about the
					rest of the program.</p>
				<p>
					.</p>
				<div style="display:block; float: right; margin: 10px;">
					<a href="./src/Ch1_Karel/tryItKarel.html?name=goodMorningKarel"
						style="display: block; text-align: center;" target="_blank"><img alt=""
							src="img/goodMorningKarel2.png" style="width: 200px; height: 200px; display: block;" />Try
						it</a>
				</div>
				<h2>
					Exercise: GoodMorningKarel</h2>
				<p>
					We want to solve our next Karel problem: Karel has just woken up and wants to drink his morning
					milk. However, the milk is still at the doorstep where the milkman left it. So Karel has to get up,
					go to the door, get the milk and then sit down at his breakfast table to drink his milk. How would
					that look in Karel&#39;s language?</p>
				<p>
					.</p>
				<h2>
					Karel learns new Tricks</h2>
				<p>
					Karel is a bit like a pet and we can teach him new tricks.&nbsp; First, let&#39;s teach him to turn
					to the right.&nbsp; We tell him that every time he sees the turnRight() command, he should turn left
					three times.&nbsp; For Karel to understand us, we have to use his language:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">
function turnRight() {
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;turnLeft();
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;turnLeft();
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;turnLeft();
}</pre>
				<p>
					Now we can just use this new command and Karel understands what to do.&nbsp; Commands we sometimes
					also call <em>functions</em>, e.g. turnRight() is a function, but also move().&nbsp; In general,
					functions are always indicated by parentheses.</p>
				<p>
					Question: What should be the syntax for a turnAround() command that causes Karel to turn around and
					look in the opposite direction?</p>
				<p>
					.</p>
				<h2>
					Exercise: GoodMorningKarel</h2>
				<p>
					To see that this really works, we want to modify our GoodMorningKarel so that it uses a turnRight()
					instead of three turnLeft()&#39;s.</p>
				<p>
					.</p>
				<h2>
					Karel repeats himself</h2>
				<p>
					It is very common that Karel should do something over and over again.&nbsp; For example, he should
					turn three times to the left or he should walk two steps.&nbsp; For this we have something called a
					loop, more precisely a &#39;for loop&#39;.&nbsp; In Karel&#39;s language this looks like:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">
function turnRight() {
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;for (let i = 0; i &lt; <span style="color:#0000ff;">3</span>; i++) {
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;turnLeft();
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;}
}</pre>
				<p>
					What is important here is the &#39;3&#39;, which tells Karel that he should do whatever is inside
					the curly brackets, three times.&nbsp; We do not need to understand the rest for the time being.
					(Very few people understand it, they just copy the lines and change the &#39;3&#39;.)</p>
				<p>
					.</p>
				<div style="display:block; float: right; margin: 10px;">
					<a href="./src/Ch1_Karel/tryItKarel.html?name=fillRowKarel"
						style="display: block; text-align: center;" target="_blank"><img alt=""
							src="img/fillRowKarel2.png" style="width: 200px; height: 121px; display: block;" />Try
						it</a>
				</div>
				<h2>
					Exercise: FillRowKarel</h2>
				<p>
					Another application for our loop is FillRowKarel.&nbsp; We want Karel to put five beepers in a
					row.&nbsp; This actually seems to be a very simple problem, and one would think that the following
					lines</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">
function run() {
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;for (let i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;putBeeper();
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;move();
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;}
}</pre>
				<p>
					should solve the problem.</p>
				<p>
					<img alt="" src="img/deadKarel2.png"
						style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; width: 200px; height: 99px; float: right;" />However,
					we realize that Karel runs into the wall at the end and hurts himself.&nbsp; In the program we see
					that when the red window pops up in which Karel is stung by a wasp.&nbsp; To avoid this, we could
					only go through the loop four times.&nbsp; But then Karel would only put down four beepers and not
					five.&nbsp; This problem occurs so often that it has a name: it is called the O-Bob problem.
				</p>
				<p>
					.</p>
				<h2>
					OBOB</h2>
				<p>
					O-Bob was a Jedi master who first noticed this problem when he tried to program his droid.&nbsp;
					Seriously, OBOB actually stands for &#39;off by one bug&#39;, usually one to few.&nbsp; In our
					FillRowKarel problem this means that Karel simply has to put an extra beeper in the end:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">
function run() {
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;for (let i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) {
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;putBeeper();
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;move();
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;}
	putBeeper();
}</pre>
				<p>
					Right now, we have to live with that.&nbsp; In the next chapter we will see how the
					&#39;Loop-and-a-half&#39; can be used to avoid the O-Bob problem elegantly.</p>
				<p>
					.</p>
				<h2>
					Karel has Sensors</h2>
				<p>
					There&#39;s one little thing I haven&#39;t told you yet: Karel has sensors.&nbsp; For example, he
					can sense if there is a beeper at the location he is at the moment.&nbsp; So if we wanted Karel to
					pick up a beeper, if there is one, we could use the following Karel commands:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">
if ( beepersPresent() ) {
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;pickBeeper();
}
</pre>
				<p>
					So Karel has another command, the <em>if</em> command.</p>
				<p>
					Karel has a lot of sensors, the most important ones are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>beepersPresent():</strong>&nbsp; there is a beeper at the current location,
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>noBeepersPresent():</strong>&nbsp; there is no beeper at the current location,
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>frontIsClear():</strong>&nbsp; there is no wall in front of Karel, and
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>frontIsBlocked():</strong>&nbsp; there is a wall in front of Karel, so Karel should not
						try to move forward or he will hit his head.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Additionally, there are also sensors for rightIsClear() and leftIsClear(), together with their
					respective blocked variants.&nbsp; Right actually means down, and left actually means up, always
					relative to the direction in which Karel is looking.</p>
				<p>
					.</p>
				<h2>
					Karel, go ahead</h2>
				<p>
					Very often we want Karel to do something until something happens.&nbsp; For example, as long as
					there is no wall in front of him, Karel should move straight.&nbsp; This is where Karel&#39;s while
					command comes in handy:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">
while ( frontIsClear() ) {
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;move();
}
</pre>
				<p>
					i.e., as long as there is no wall in front of him, Karel should move straight.&nbsp; This construct
					is called the &#39;while loop&#39;.</p>
				<p>
					.</p>
				<div style="display:block; float: right; margin: 10px;">
					<a href="./src/Ch1_Karel/tryItKarel.html?name=wallKarel" style="display: block; text-align: center;"
						target="_blank"><img alt="" src="img/wallKarel2.png"
							style="width: 200px; height: 121px; display: block;" />Try it</a>
				</div>
				<h2>
					Exercise: WallKarel</h2>
				<p>
					How would a new command <em>moveToWall()</em> look like, which causes Karel to move to the next
					wall?&nbsp; In WallKarel we want to get Karel to walk straight until a wall comes up.&nbsp; We want
					to use our new command moveToWall(), because then the code becomes very simple and elegant.</p>
				<p>
					This example leads us to our first Software Engineering Principles (SEP):</p>
				<p>
					<strong>SEP: Programs should be readable by people and should look like relatively normal
						English.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					.</p>
				<p>
					.</p>
				<div style="display:block; float: right; margin: 10px;">
					<a href="./src/Ch1_Karel/tryItKarel.html?name=infiniteLoopKarel"
						style="display: block; text-align: center;" target="_blank"><img alt=""
							src="img/infiniteLoopKarel2.png" style="width: 200px; height: 121px; display: block;" />Try
						it</a>
				</div>
				<h2>
					Exercise: InfiniteLoopKarel</h2>
				<p>
					The while loop is not entirely unproblematic: because Karel does something until something special
					happens.&nbsp; In our InfiniteLoopKarel example, Karel should turn to the left until there is no
					more wall in front of him:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">
while ( frontIsClear() ) {
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;turnLeft();
}
</pre>
				<p>
					This works well as long as Karel is somewhere next to a wall.&nbsp; But if Karel is in the middle of
					his world, he does not stop turning.&nbsp; This is then called an infinite loop or Merry-Go-Round
					Karel.</p>
				<p>
					.</p>
				<p>
					.</p>
				<p>
					.</p>
				<div style="display:block; float: right; margin: 10px;">
					<a href="./src/Ch1_Karel/tryItKarel.html?name=robinHoodKarel"
						style="display: block; text-align: center;" target="_blank"><img alt=""
							src="img/robinHoodKarel2.png" style="width: 200px; height: 121px; display: block;" />Try
						it</a>
				</div>
				<h2>
					Exercise: RobinHoodKarel</h2>
				<p>
					Karel loves the movies.&nbsp; The other day he saw the movie &#39;Robin Hood&#39;.&nbsp; According
					to his motto &#39;take from the rich and give to the poor&#39;, Karel walks through his world and
					every time there is a beeper in the streets he picks it up, and whenever there is no beeper, he puts
					one down.<br />
					To do this, we can use Karel&#39;s sensors:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">
if ( beepersPresent() ) {
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;pickBeeper();
}&nbsp; &nbsp;
if ( noBeepersPresent() ) {
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;putBeeper();
}
</pre>
				<p>
					If we put these lines inside our while loop above, then we almost solved our problem.&nbsp; It works
					fine if there is no beeper.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, if there is one, Karel first removes it.&nbsp; But
					then he sees that there is no beeper, and hence puts a beeper where he shouldn&#39;t.&nbsp; To solve
					this problem we need the else command:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">
if ( beepersPresent() ) {
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;pickBeeper();
}&nbsp;else {
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;putBeeper();
}
</pre>
				<p>
					It reads like this: if there&#39;s a beeper pick it up, otherwise put one down.</p>
				<p>
					.</p>
				<h2>
					Top-Down Approach</h2>
				<p>
					In principle, there are two ways to solve any problem.&nbsp; One is the bottom-up approach: starting
					from the things you know, you try to solve the problem.&nbsp; So far we have used this approach to
					solve our Karel problems: with the few commands Karel knows and his sensors, we have solved simple
					problem step by step.&nbsp; For simple problems this works quite well.<br />
					For more complex problems, however, this no longer works very well.&nbsp; The top-down method
					becomes extremely helpful here.&nbsp; In the top-down approach we usually have a problem, which
					seems impossible to solve at first.&nbsp; However, one very often succeeds in breaking down the
					complex problem into smaller sub-problems.&nbsp; Sometimes those can be solved directly, sometimes
					those have to be broken down into even smaller sub-problems.&nbsp; This process is called
					&#39;stepwise refinement&#39;.&nbsp; Let&#39;s take a look at the WindowCleaningKarel example, and
					see how it works.</p>
				<p>
					.</p>
				<div style="display:block; float: right; margin: 10px;">
					<a href="./src/Ch1_Karel/tryItKarel.html?name=windowCleaningKarel"
						style="display: block; text-align: center;" target="_blank"><img alt=""
							src="img/windowCleaningKarel2.png"
							style="width: 200px; height: 200px; display: block;" />Try it</a>
				</div>
				<h2>
					Exercise: WindowCleaningKarel</h2>
				<p>
					Karel lives in Chicago.&nbsp; And he makes a living by cleaning windows.&nbsp; The job is not
					entirely harmless, since he is cleaning skyscrapers.&nbsp; Karel has to clean five skyscrapers a
					week.&nbsp; They are not all the same, some are higher some are less high.&nbsp; Actually, Karel
					likes the higher ones better, but they&#39;re more work.<br />
					We want to solve this problem using the top-down approach.&nbsp; It is therefore a question of
					breaking down the big problem into smaller ones.&nbsp; Suppose we knew how Karel cleans one
					skyscraper, so assume we had a function called <em>cleanOneSkyScraper()</em>.&nbsp; Then the
					solution to our problem would be very simple, we would just use cleanOneSkyScraper() five times:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">
for (let i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;cleanOneSkyScraper();
}
</pre>
				<p>
					So we&#39;ve solved our big problem.<br />
					Now we have to solve the slightly smaller problem cleanOneSkyScraper().&nbsp; How does Karel clean
					one skyscraper?&nbsp; Still the problem is to complicated to solve it with move&#39;s and
					turnLeft&#39;s.&nbsp; Hence, we need to break it down one more time.&nbsp; If we knew how Karel
					moves up the skyscraper, moveUpAndClean(), moves over the skyscraper, moveOver(), and on the other
					side then moves down the skyscraper again, moveDownAndClean(), then we would have solved the problem
					cleanOneSkyScraper():</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">
function cleanOneSkyscraper() {
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;moveUpAndClean();
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;moveOver();
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;moveDownAndClean();
}
</pre>
				<p>
					Although we are not quite finished yet, we can see that we are basically done.&nbsp; We can easily
					solve the last three commands.&nbsp; For moveUpAndClean(), we let Karel turn to the left, and then
					let him move as long as his right side is blocked.&nbsp; For moveOver(), we let Karel turn right,
					move two steps forward and then turn right again. moveDownAndClean() is actually like moveToWall(),
					but at the end he has to turn left once more.</p>
				<p>
					.</p>
				<h2>
					Recommendations for the Top-Down Approach</h2>
				<p>
					Sometimes it is not quite clear when the top-down approach is finished.&nbsp; Here are a few
					recommendations to help you:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						one function should solve exactly one problem,</li>
					<li>
						a function should not have more than 15 lines of code, around five lines is ideal, and</li>
					<li>
						function names should describe what the function does.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					.</p>
				<h2>
					Comments</h2>
				<p>
					Every good program has comments.&nbsp; The more important it is, the more comments it has.&nbsp;
					What are comments?&nbsp; Comments are descriptions of what the program, what the code does.&nbsp;
					They are intended for people who are trying to understand the program.&nbsp; The computer ignores
					the comments.<br />
					The syntax is actually quite simple: a comment starts with the characters &#39;/**&#39; and ends
					with the characters &#39;*/&#39;.&nbsp; Usually a comment is located at the very beginning of a
					program and explains what the program as a whole does.&nbsp; In addition, you should briefly
					describe what each function does.&nbsp; If you want to do it really well, then you also describe
					briefly which assumptions you make when the function is called (pre-conditions) and in what state
					you leave the world after the function is finished (post-conditions).</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">
/**
&nbsp;* Karel has to clean five skyscrapers, one at a time.
&nbsp;*
&nbsp;* PreCondition: Karel is standing in front of the first skyscraper, facing
&nbsp;* east &lt;br/&gt;
&nbsp;* PostCondition: Karel is standing behind the last skyscraper, facing east
&nbsp;*/
function run() {
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;for (let i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;cleanOneSkyscraper();
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;}
}

/**
&nbsp;* Karel has to clean one skyscraper
&nbsp;*
&nbsp;* PreCondition: Karel is standing in front of the one skyscraper, facing
&nbsp;* east &lt;br/&gt;
&nbsp;* PostCondition: Karel is standing behind this one skyscraper, facing east
&nbsp;*/
function cleanOneSkyscraper() {
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;moveUpAndClean();
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;moveOver();
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;moveDownAndClean();
}
...
</pre>
				<p>
					If the functions are kept short, comments within functions are not necessary.&nbsp; Again, the point
					is that programs should read like good English.</p>
				<p>
					.</p>
				<h2>
					Exercise: Comments</h2>
				<p>
					As a little exercise, we want to add detailed comments to the WindowCleaningKarel program.&nbsp; For
					all future programs we write, we should get used to adding a little comment to each program and
					function.&nbsp; This makes the programs easier to understand (for people).</p>
				<p>

				<h1>
					Review</h1>
				<p>
					In this chapter we have taken our first programming steps by helping Karel to solve his
					problems.&nbsp; In addition,</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						we have taught Karel new commands, also called functions, e.g. moveToWall(),</li>
					<li>
						we let Karel repeat things with the for loop, e.g. make three steps forward,</li>
					<li>
						we have seen that Karel has sensors and we got to know the if statement,</li>
					<li>
						we learned about the while loop,</li>
					<li>
						we acquainted ourselves with our first software engineering principles,</li>
					<li>
						we made our first programming errors, e.g. the OBOB and the infinite loop, &nbsp;</li>
					<li>
						and we learned about comments.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					But the most important thing we learned in this chapter was the top-down approach.&nbsp; Its goal is
					to break down a big problem into smaller ones, and to repeat this until each sub-problem is easy to
					solve.&nbsp; This approach can be applied not only to programming problems, but also to solve
					problems in all possible other fields.</p>
				<p>
					.</p>

				<h1>
					Projects</h1>
				<p>
					We know enough about Karel now to help him solve any problems he may have.&nbsp; In the book by
					Pavel Solin [4] there are many more Karel examples.</p>

					AdventureKarel</h2>
				<p>
					Karel is not a coward, on the contrary, he loves adventures.&nbsp; But that can be quite dangerous
					sometimes.&nbsp; The other day he was at the White Cliffs of Dover.&nbsp; Of course he wants to get
					as close as possible, but he doesn&#39;t want to fall over either (Karel can&#39;t swim).&nbsp; What
					makes this problem hard is that we don&#39;t know how far the cliffs are.</p>

					PartyKarel</h2>
				<p>
					Karel lives in a flat, which he shares with his brother SuperKarel.&nbsp; Both love parties and
					after the last one it looks like cabbage and turnips in their apartment.&nbsp; Tonight Karel&#39;s
					parents are coming to visit, so he has to clean up.&nbsp; Let&#39;s help Karel fix his apartment by
					cleaning up all the beepers lying around.<br />
					The part that makes this program a bit complicated is that Karel should stop after cleaning
					everything up.</p>

					Karel loves Easter and searching for Easter eggs.&nbsp; His parents were hiding them all over the
					garden, so we&#39;ll help Karel collect all the Easter eggs.&nbsp; Since he will visits his
					grandparents later, and their garden is much larger, the program must also work for gardens of
					different sizes.<br />
					Again, we want to make sure Karel stops when he is finished.</p>

					TulipKarel</h2>
				<p>
					Karel has Dutch ancestors, that&#39;s why he loves tulips.&nbsp; And every winter he plants tulip
					bulbs, so that his garden is full of tulips again in spring.&nbsp; Let&#39;s help Karel with
					planting the tulips, but using the top-down approach.&nbsp; Since Karel also plants tulips for his
					parents and grandparents, our program has to work for differently sized gardens.</p>

				<p>
					From time to time there are tornadoes in Chicago.&nbsp; The last one got Karel&#39;s house.&nbsp; It
					is still standing but the pillars have gotten some damage and have to be repaired.&nbsp; In
					Karel&#39;s house there are three pillars, which are of course made of beepers.&nbsp; The three
					pillars are three steps apart, but could be of different heights.&nbsp; Let&#39;s help Karel repair
					his house, of course with the top-down approach.</p>

				<h2>
					PyramidKarel</h2>
				<p>
					We have already heard that Karel is a little adventurer.&nbsp; The other day he saw a report on TV
					about the pyramids, and of course he has to build one in his garden immediately.&nbsp; Since he
					wants to build several, of different sizes, our program should work in worlds with different sizes
					as well, so it makes sense to use the top-down approach again.</p>

				<h2>
					YardstickKarel</h2>
				<p>
					Karel is not quite as stupid as he looks.&nbsp; He can actually count even though he has no fingers
					(or variables).&nbsp; Karel counts with beepers.&nbsp; In this example he is supposed to measure how
					long the yardstick in front of him is.&nbsp; So we want him to put as many beepers as the yardstick
					is long, at the end of the street he is standing on.<br />
					We can assume that Karel is standing just before the yardstick.</p>

				<h2>
					DoubleBeeperKarel</h2>
				<p>
					Karel can also do math.&nbsp; In this example he should double the number of beepers lying on the
					pile in front of him.&nbsp; After being finished, we want Karel to stand in front of the pile
					again.&nbsp; Very important: Karel does not know about variables, and although he can count (see
					last example) this does not really help.&nbsp; Furthermore, the program should work for any number
					of beepers.</p>
				<p>
					The easiest way to solve this problem is the top-down approach.&nbsp; How about turning one beeper
					into two?&nbsp; And you do that until there are no more beepers.</p>
				<p>
					Question: What would the code look like if Karel is to triple or halve the number of beepers?</p>
				<p>
					So Karel can do any of the basic arithmetic operations, and with those he can actually calculate
					anything there is to be calculated, one also says Karel is a <em>Universal Computing Machine</em>.

				<h2>
					DonkeyKongKarel</h2>
				<p>
					Karel likes to play computer games when not cleaning windows. Preferably the classic arcade games of
					the 80&#39;s. His favorite game is Donkey Kong. This game is about collecting as many beepers as
					possible and moving from one level to the next. The exit is at the top right and we can assume that
					one level consists of nine floors.</p>
				<p>
					Of course we use the top-down approach again.</p>

				<h2>
					BreadcrumbKarel</h2>
				<p>
					Karel read about the Cretan princess Ariadne and how she helped Theseus to escape the labyrinth of
					the Minotaur.&nbsp; So he thought he could do the same thing using breadcrumbs.</p>

					Questions</h1>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Name the four most important commands of Karel.<br />
						&nbsp;</li>
					<li>
						Give an example of an Off By One Bug (OBOB).<br />
						&nbsp;</li>
					<li>
						In the exercise &quot;PartyKarel&quot; you taught Karel how to clean up. Explain briefly how
						Karel will clean up the beeper chaos. (No code required, just outline your procedure in
						words)<br />
						&nbsp;</li>
					<li>
						Like 3) only with PyramidKarel, DoubleBeepersKarel, WindowCleaningKarel,...<br />
						&nbsp;</li>
					<li>
						In the lecture we got to know recommendations for the top-down approach. These are rules
						regarding the names of functions, how many lines of code a function should have, etc. Name two
						of these guidelines.<br />
						&nbsp;</li>
					<li>
						What are comments good for?<br />
						&nbsp;</li>
					<li>
						What is the difference between bottom-up design and top-down design?&nbsp; Which is
						preferable?<br />
						&nbsp;</li>
					<li>
						Karel watched the film &#39;Robin Hood&#39; and was totally impressed by the hero. That is why
						he wants to follow his example &quot;take from the rich and give to the poor&quot;. So you
						should write a Karel program in which Karel picks up a beeper when he finds one and puts one
						down when there is none.&nbsp; To solve the problem, you may make the following assumptions
						about the world:<br />
						&bull; The world is at least 3x3.<br />
						&bull; At the start, Karel stands at the corner of 1st Street and 1st Avenue, looking east and
						has an infinite number of beepers in his beeper bag.<br />
						Make sure that you only use Karel commands.</li>
