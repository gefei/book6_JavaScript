<h1>
	Console</h1>
<p>
	Console programs are actually even easier to write than graphics programs.&nbsp; Console programs are text based and they are about interacting with our users.&nbsp; Many concepts we have learned and used in the last two chapters will become clearer in this chapter and they will be set in a new context and explained in more detail.</p>

<p>
	Let&#39;s have a look at a simple &#39;HelloWorld&#39; console program:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">
async function setup() {
&nbsp; createConsole();
&nbsp; println(&#39;Hello World!&#39;);
}</pre>
<p>
	As usual, we are only interested in the code inside the run() method.&nbsp; It basically tells the computer to display the text in quotation marks, i.e. &quot;Hello World&quot;, in a console window.&nbsp; &#39;println&#39; is the short form for &#39;print line&#39; and means exactly that, so write a line in the console window.</p>
